                A time tracker is computer software or a web app that allows
                teams, managers, and freelancers to measure time spent on tasks
                and projects. It is used in many industries (law firms,
                accounting, creative agencies, IT teams) for settling up with
                hourly workers and billing clients for work. You can integrate a
                time tracker with third-party tools for project management,
                accounting, customer service, to-do lists, and many more.
                Speaking shortly, a time tracker helps you understand which
                practices in your business lead to time waste. With this
                knowledge, you can reduce bad practices and optimize workflow.

                There are many reasons to use time tracking software. Here are
                the main use cases for a time tracker: Tracking billable hours:
                helps freelancers and employees who are paid on an hourly basis
                measure time spent on work with accuracy up to every second.
                Improving productivity: employees who struggle with poor time
                management and distractions can work on their efficiency,
                understand how they work, and what takes most of their time.
                Timesheet management: one of the most common features of time
                tracker is a timesheet – a digital version of a paper timesheet.
                With a time tracker, your team can have it filled out
                automatically. Work automation: time tracker helps to save time
                on administrative and repetitive tasks, better allocate
                resources, cut costs, and smoothen teams’ workflow.
